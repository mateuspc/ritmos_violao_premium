    - assets/imagens/icone_olho_fechado.svg

  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Co Headline Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Co Headline Bold.ttf
    - family: Co Headline Light
      fonts:
